- **Naming**: Use kebab-case: `frontend-security.md`
- **Format**: YAML frontmatter + Markdown content

### 2. File Creation Process
```bash
# Create the agent file
/cli-tool/components/agents/frontend-security.md
```

### 3. Required YAML Frontmatter Structure
```yaml
---
name: frontend-security
description: Use this agent when securing frontend applications. Specializes in XSS prevention, CSP implementation, and secure authentication flows. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to secure React app user: 'My React app is vulnerable to XSS attacks' assistant: 'I'll use the frontend-security agent to analyze and implement XSS protections' <commentary>Frontend security issues require specialized expertise</commentary></example>
color: red
---
```

**Required Frontmatter Fields:**
- `name`: Unique identifier (kebab-case, matches filename)
- `description`: Clear description with 2-3 usage examples in specific format
- `color`: Display color (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, gray)

### 4. Agent Content Structure
```markdown

### XSS Prevention
```javascript
// Secure input handling
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const sanitizeInput = (userInput) => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong'],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: []
  });
};
```

Always provide specific, actionable security recommendations with code examples.
```

### 5. Installation Command Result
After creating the agent, users can install it with:
```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent="frontend-security" --yes
```

This will:
- Read from `cli-tool/components/agents/frontend-security.md`
- Copy the agent to the user's `.claude/agents/` directory
- Enable the agent for Claude Code usage

### 6. Usage in Claude Code
Users can then invoke the agent in conversations:
- Claude Code will automatically suggest this agent for frontend security questions
- Users can reference it explicitly when needed

### 7. Testing Workflow
1. Create the agent file in correct location with proper frontmatter
2. Test the installation command
3. Verify the agent works in Claude Code context
4. Test agent selection with various prompts
5. Ensure expertise boundaries are clear

### 8. Example Creation

## MCP Tool Integration Guidelines

### Identifying MCP Tools for New Agents

When creating any new agent, ALWAYS include an MCP tools section that identifies:

1. **Currently Available MCP Tools**
   - `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics`: IDE diagnostics and language server insights
   - `mcp__ide__executeCode`: Execute code in Jupyter notebooks

2. **Domain-Specific MCP Tool Recommendations**
   Based on the agent's domain, suggest relevant MCP tools:

   **For Code Review Agents**:
   - GitHub API MCP (PR access, comments, reviews)
   - Static Analysis MCP (linting, complexity)
   - Security Scanner MCP (vulnerability detection)
   - Test Coverage MCP (coverage reports)

   **For Frontend Agents**:
   - Browser DevTools MCP (performance metrics)
   - Accessibility Testing MCP (a11y validation)
   - Bundle Analyzer MCP (size optimization)
   - Component Testing MCP (UI testing)

   **For Backend Agents**:
   - Database Query Analyzer MCP
   - API Testing MCP (endpoint validation)
   - Performance Profiler MCP
   - Log Analysis MCP

   **For Security Agents**:

   - **[Tool Category]**: [Tool name and purpose]
   
   ### MCP Usage Examples
   ```python
   # Current tools
   diagnostics = mcp__ide__getDiagnostics(uri="file:///path")
   
   # Future tools (when available)
   # results = mcp.[category].[method](params)
   ```
   
   ### Fallback Strategies
   When MCP tools are unavailable, use:
   - CLI commands: [specific commands]
   - File analysis: [parsing strategies]
   - Pattern matching: [detection methods]
   ```

### MCP Tool Selection Criteria

When recommending MCP tools for an agent:
1. **Relevance**: Tool directly supports agent's core tasks
2. **Efficiency**: Significant improvement over CLI alternatives
3. **Integration**: Works well with other agent capabilities
4. **Fallback**: Clear alternative when tool unavailable

### Example: Adding MCP Tools to a Testing Agent

```markdown
## MCP Tool Integration

### Available MCP Tools
- `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics`: Get test file errors
- `mcp__ide__executeCode`: Run test snippets in notebooks

### Recommended MCP Tools (When Available)
- **Test Runner MCP**: Execute tests with coverage
- **Mutation Testing MCP**: Code mutation analysis
- **Test Generator MCP**: Auto-generate test cases
- **Mock Service MCP**: Manage test doubles

### MCP Usage Examples
```python
# Run tests with coverage
coverage = mcp.testing.run_with_coverage("src/", "tests/")

# Generate test suggestions
suggestions = mcp.testing.suggest_tests("src/api.py")

# Fallback to CLI
if not mcp.testing.available():
    coverage = run_command("pytest --cov=src tests/")
```
```
