## Example Review Scenarios

### Security Vulnerability Detection
```javascript
// Vulnerable code
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}`;
  db.query(query, (err, result) => {
    res.json(result);
  });
});
```

**Review Comment**:
```markdown
**Issue**: Security - SQL Injection vulnerability
**Severity**: 🔴 High
**Details**: Direct string interpolation in SQL query allows injection attacks
**Suggestion**: Use parameterized queries:
\`\`\`javascript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [req.params.id], (err, result) => {
  res.json(result);
});
\`\`\`
```

### Performance Optimization
```python
# Inefficient code
def find_duplicates(items):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(items)):
            if items[i] == items[j] and items[i] not in duplicates:
                duplicates.append(items[i])
    return duplicates
```

**Review Comment**:
```markdown
**Issue**: Performance - O(n²) algorithm for duplicate detection
**Severity**: 🟡 Medium
**Details**: Nested loops create quadratic time complexity
**Suggestion**: Use set for O(n) solution:
\`\`\`python
def find_duplicates(items):
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()
    for item in items:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        seen.add(item)
    return list(duplicates)
\`\`\`
```

## MCP Tool Integration

### Available MCP Tools

When MCP tools are available, leverage them for enhanced review capabilities:

#### 1. IDE Diagnostics (Currently Available)
```bash
# Use mcp__ide__getDiagnostics to get language server diagnostics
mcp__ide__getDiagnostics --uri "file:///path/to/changed/file.ts"
```
This provides:
- Syntax errors
- Type errors
- Linting warnings
- IDE-level code issues

#### 2. GitHub API MCP (When Available)
Instead of CLI commands, use direct API access:
```python
# Direct PR access
pr_data = mcp.github.get_pr(pr_number)
diff = mcp.github.get_pr_diff(pr_number)
review_threads = mcp.github.get_review_threads(pr_number)

# Post reviews efficiently
mcp.github.post_review_comment(
    pr_number=123,
    file="src/api.js",
    line=42,
    comment="Security issue: SQL injection vulnerability"
)
```

#### 3. Static Analysis MCP (When Available)
```python
# Run comprehensive analysis
security_scan = mcp.security.scan_files(changed_files)
complexity_report = mcp.analysis.calculate_complexity(diff)
lint_results = mcp.linters.run_all(changed_files)
```

#### 4. Test Coverage MCP (When Available)
```python
# Analyze test coverage
coverage_delta = mcp.testing.get_coverage_delta(pr_number)
uncovered_lines = mcp.testing.find_uncovered_changes(diff)
test_suggestions = mcp.testing.suggest_tests(changed_code)
```

#### 5. Security Scanner MCP (When Available)
```python
# Deep security analysis
vulnerabilities = mcp.security.scan_vulnerabilities(diff)
secrets = mcp.security.detect_secrets(changed_files)
dependencies = mcp.security.check_dependencies(pr_number)
owasp_issues = mcp.security.run_owasp_scan(changed_files)
```

#### 6. Performance Profiler MCP (When Available)
```python
# Performance impact analysis
perf_regression = mcp.performance.detect_regressions(diff)
complexity_increase = mcp.performance.analyze_complexity_delta(pr_number)
db_query_analysis = mcp.performance.analyze_queries(changed_files)
```

#### 7. Project Context MCP (When Available)
```python
# Access project standards
coding_standards = mcp.project.get_coding_standards()
review_checklist = mcp.project.get_review_checklist()
architecture_rules = mcp.project.get_architecture_rules()
team_conventions = mcp.project.get_team_conventions()
```

### MCP-Enhanced Review Workflow

1. **Initial Analysis with MCP Tools**
```python
# Gather all data in parallel
pr_data = mcp.github.get_pr(pr_number)
diagnostics = mcp__ide__getDiagnostics()
security_scan = mcp.security.scan_files(pr_data.files)
test_coverage = mcp.testing.get_coverage_delta(pr_number)
perf_analysis = mcp.performance.analyze_changes(pr_data.diff)
```

2. **Intelligent Issue Detection**
```python
# Combine multiple MCP sources
all_issues = []
all_issues.extend(diagnostics.errors)
all_issues.extend(security_scan.vulnerabilities)
all_issues.extend(test_coverage.uncovered_critical_paths)
all_issues.extend(perf_analysis.regressions)

# Prioritize by severity
critical_issues = filter_critical(all_issues)
```

3. **Enhanced Review Comments**
```markdown
**Issue**: [Category] - [Brief description]
**Severity**: 🔴 High
**Details**: [Explanation]
**MCP Analysis**:
- Security Scanner: [specific vulnerability detected]
- Performance Profiler: [measured impact]
- Test Coverage: [missing test scenarios]
**Suggestion**: [Specific fix with code example]
```

### MCP Tool Fallback Strategy

When MCP tools are not available, fallback to CLI commands:
```python
def get_pr_diff(pr_number):
    if mcp.github.available():
        return mcp.github.get_pr_diff(pr_number)
    else:
        return run_command(f"gh pr diff {pr_number}")

def run_security_scan(files):
    if mcp.security.available():
        return mcp.security.scan_files(files)
    else:
        # Fallback to basic pattern matching
        return basic_security_patterns(files)
```

### Example MCP-Enhanced Review

```python
# Complete MCP-powered review
async def review_pr_with_mcp(pr_url):
    pr_number = extract_pr_number(pr_url)
    
    # Parallel MCP analysis
    results = await gather(
        mcp.github.get_pr(pr_number),
        mcp__ide__getDiagnostics(),
        mcp.security.full_scan(pr_number),
        mcp.testing.analyze_coverage(pr_number),
        mcp.performance.profile_changes(pr_number),
        mcp.project.get_standards()
    )
    
    # Generate comprehensive review
    review = generate_review(results)
    
    # Post review with MCP
    await mcp.github.post_review(pr_number, review)
```

### MCP Tool Benefits
