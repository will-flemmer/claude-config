- [ ] Code is properly tested (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Documentation is updated (user guides, API docs)
- [ ] Feature is accessible and follows UI/UX guidelines
- [ ] Performance requirements are met
- [ ] Security considerations are addressed
- [ ] Code review is completed and approved
- [ ] Feature is deployed to staging and tested
- [ ] Stakeholder approval is obtained
```

## Characteristics

- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks
- **Typical Labels**: feature, user-story, enhancement
- **Assignable**: Small team (2-4 developers)
- **Dependencies**: May have external dependencies

## Best Practices

1. **User-Centric**: Always start with user needs and benefits
2. **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of the feature
3. **Testable**: Each criterion should be verifiable
4. **Collaborative**: Involve stakeholders in definition
5. **Iterative**: Can be broken into smaller tasks if needed

## Examples

### Good Story Issues
- "Implement two-factor authentication for enhanced security"
- "Build advanced search with filters and sorting options" 
- "Create user onboarding flow with guided tutorials"
- "Develop real-time chat functionality for customer support"

### Poor Story Issues  
- "Add a button" (too small, should be task)
- "Build the entire platform" (too large, should be project)
- "Make users happy" (not specific or actionable)
- "Fix authentication" (maintenance task, not new feature)

## Story Breakdown

Large stories can be broken down into tasks:

### Example: "Implement user authentication system"
**Tasks:**
- Create user registration API endpoint
- Build login/logout functionality  
- Design password reset flow
- Implement session management
- Add OAuth integration options
- Create user profile management
- Build admin user management interface

## Dependencies and Relationships

- **Depends On**: Infrastructure, database changes, external services
- **Blocks**: Other features requiring authentication
- **Related**: User management, security features, onboarding flows
