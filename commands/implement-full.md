# implement-full

Comprehensive workflow command that implements a coding task using the Explore, Plan, Code methodology with TDD principles, automated PR creation, checks, and review iteration.

## CRITICAL: Complete ALL Steps

**IMPORTANT**: This workflow consists of MULTIPLE PHASES that MUST ALL be completed:
1. **Phase 1**: Implementation (Explore, Plan, Code)
2. **Phase 2**: PR Creation and Commit
3. **Phase 3**: PR Checks Monitoring
4. **Phase 4**: Code Review and Iteration

**The agent MUST complete ALL phases. Do NOT stop after Phase 1.**

## Usage

This is a Claude Code workflow command. To execute:

1. Clear your Claude Code session history
2. Copy and paste the ENTIRE workflow prompt below
3. Replace `[TASK DESCRIPTION]` with your specific task
4. Submit to Claude Code

## Complete Workflow Prompt

```
I need you to complete the ENTIRE implement-full workflow for the following task:

TASK: [TASK DESCRIPTION]

YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL 4 PHASES. DO NOT STOP UNTIL THE PR IS CREATED AND REVIEWED.

PHASE 1: IMPLEMENTATION
======================
1. EXPLORE: Understand the existing codebase and requirements
   - Search for related files and patterns
   - Read existing code to understand conventions
   - Identify where new code should be placed

2. PLAN: Create a detailed implementation plan using TDD principles
   - List all test cases to write
   - Define the API/interface
   - Break down into RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles

3. CODE: Implement the solution following ALL coding guidelines in CLAUDE.md
   - Write failing tests first (RED)
   - Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
   - Refactor to improve quality (REFACTOR)
   - Ensure 100% test coverage
   - Run all tests and quality checks
   - Perform manual smoke testing

PHASE 2: PR CREATION (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)
==============================================
After completing implementation, you MUST:

1. Create a semantic branch name from the task description
   Example: "create-user-authentication-system"

2. Create the branch and switch to it:
   git checkout -b [branch-name]

3. Stage all changes:
   git add .

4. Create a comprehensive commit with smoke test results:
   git commit -m "feat: [task description]

   Implemented using TDD methodology:
   - [list key features implemented]
   - 100% test coverage achieved
   - All quality standards met
   
   Smoke Test Results:
   - [list all manual tests performed]
   - [confirm all functionality works as expected]

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

5. Push the branch:
   git push -u origin [branch-name]

6. Create the pull request:
   gh pr create --title "feat: [task description]" --body "## Summary
   [2-3 bullet points describing what was implemented]
   
   ## Implementation Details
   - Followed TDD methodology
   - 100% test coverage
   - All quality standards met
   
   ## Testing
   - [ ] All unit tests pass
   - [ ] Manual smoke testing completed
   - [ ] Code quality checks pass
   
   ## Checklist
   - [ ] Tests written first (TDD)
   - [ ] 100% test coverage
   - [ ] Functions < 20 lines
   - [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 5
   - [ ] At least 2 assertions per function
   - [ ] Error handling implemented
   - [ ] No code duplication
   
   ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code"

7. Save the PR URL for the next phase

PHASE 3: PR CHECKS (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)
============================================
After creating the PR, you MUST:

1. Wait for PR checks to complete:
   gh pr checks --watch

2. If any checks fail:
   - View the detailed logs
   - Fix the issues
   - Commit and push the fixes
   - Wait for checks to re-run

3. Continue until ALL checks pass

PHASE 4: CODE REVIEW (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)
==============================================
After all checks pass, you MUST:

1. Get the PR URL from Phase 2

2. Initiate a code review using:
   /review-pr [PR-URL]

3. Address ALL review feedback:
   - Make requested changes
   - Commit with descriptive messages
   - Push to update the PR

4. Continue iterating until the reviewer approves

COMPLETION CRITERIA
==================
The workflow is ONLY complete when:
âœ… Implementation is done with 100% test coverage
âœ… PR is created with comprehensive description
âœ… All PR checks pass
âœ… Code review feedback is addressed
âœ… PR is approved by reviewer

DO NOT STOP until ALL criteria are met.
```

## Detailed Phase Descriptions

### Phase 1: Implementation (Explore, Plan, Code)

This phase involves understanding the codebase and implementing the solution using TDD.

**Key Activities:**
- Search and read existing code
- Create a TDD implementation plan
- Write tests first, then implementation
- Ensure all quality standards are met
- Perform comprehensive smoke testing

**Common Mistake**: Agents often stop here. YOU MUST CONTINUE TO PHASE 2.

### Phase 2: PR Creation and Management

This phase involves creating a feature branch, committing changes, and opening a pull request.

**Key Activities:**
- Create semantic branch name
- Make comprehensive commit with smoke test results
- Push to remote repository
- Create PR with detailed description
- Save PR URL for later phases

**Common Mistake**: Forgetting to push or create the PR. ALL steps are required.

### Phase 3: Quality Validation

This phase ensures all automated checks pass before proceeding to review.

**Key Activities:**
- Monitor PR check status
- Review failed check logs
- Fix any issues found
- Re-run checks until all pass

**Common Mistake**: Not waiting for checks or ignoring failures.

### Phase 4: Code Review Loop

This phase involves getting the code reviewed and addressing all feedback.

**Key Activities:**
- Initiate automated code review
- Read all review comments
- Make requested changes
- Commit and push updates
- Continue until approved

**Common Mistake**: Not addressing all feedback or stopping after first review.

## Requirements

- **Git**: Must be in a git repository
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Must be installed and authenticated
- **Claude Code**: Must have access to `/review-pr` command
- **Repository Access**: Must have permissions to create branches and PRs

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Only Completes Phase 1

**Problem**: The agent implements the code but doesn't create a PR.

**Solution**: 
1. Explicitly remind the agent about ALL 4 phases
2. Copy the complete workflow prompt above
3. Emphasize "DO NOT STOP until the PR is created and reviewed"

### PR Creation Fails

**Problem**: Git or GitHub CLI errors during PR creation.

**Solutions**:
- Verify `gh auth status` shows you're logged in
- Ensure you have push permissions to the repository
- Check that you're not already on a feature branch

### Checks Never Complete

**Problem**: PR checks hang or timeout.

**Solutions**:
- Use `gh pr checks` without `--watch` to see current status
- Check GitHub Actions tab in the repository
- Look for configuration issues in CI/CD

### Review Command Not Found

**Problem**: `/review-pr` command is not recognized.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you're using Claude Code (not regular Claude)
- Check that the review-pr command is properly configured
- Try using the full command syntax with the PR URL

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Task Descriptions**: Be specific about what needs to be implemented
2. **Follow TDD Strictly**: Never write code without a failing test first
3. **Complete All Phases**: Don't let the agent stop early
4. **Address All Feedback**: Ensure every review comment is resolved
5. **Verify Completion**: Check that the PR exists and has been reviewed

## Example Execution

```
I need you to complete the ENTIRE implement-full workflow for the following task:

TASK: Create a user authentication system with JWT tokens

YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL 4 PHASES. DO NOT STOP UNTIL THE PR IS CREATED AND REVIEWED.

[... rest of the workflow prompt ...]
```

The agent should then:
1. âœ… Explore existing auth code
2. âœ… Plan JWT implementation with tests
3. âœ… Implement with TDD
4. âœ… Create branch and commit
5. âœ… Push and create PR
6. âœ… Monitor PR checks
7. âœ… Run code review
8. âœ… Address feedback
9. âœ… Continue until approved

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Stopping After Implementation**: The workflow is NOT complete after coding
2. **Skipping Tests**: TDD means tests MUST come first
3. **Ignoring Checks**: Failed checks must be fixed before review
4. **Incomplete Reviews**: ALL feedback must be addressed
5. **No Smoke Testing**: Manual testing is required before committing

## Verification Checklist

Before considering the workflow complete, verify:
- [ ] All tests pass with 100% coverage
- [ ] Code follows all quality standards
- [ ] Branch is created and pushed
- [ ] PR is opened with proper description
- [ ] All PR checks pass
- [ ] Code review has been conducted
- [ ] All review feedback is addressed
- [ ] PR is approved

Only when ALL items are checked is the workflow truly complete.
