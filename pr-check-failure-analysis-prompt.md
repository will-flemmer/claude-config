    }
  ]
}
```

## Analysis Framework

For each failed check, perform the following analysis:

### 1. Root Cause Identification
- Parse error messages and logs systematically
- Identify primary vs secondary failures
- Determine if failures are related or independent
- Extract specific error patterns and codes

### 2. Failure Classification
Categorize each failure into one of these types:

**Build & Compilation**
- Syntax errors
- Missing dependencies  
- Configuration issues
- Compilation failures
- Asset bundling problems

**Testing**
- Unit test failures
- Integration test failures
- E2E test failures
- Test configuration issues
- Coverage threshold failures

**Code Quality & Linting**
- ESLint/Pylint violations
- Formatting issues (Prettier, Black)
- Code complexity violations
- Import/export issues
- Naming convention violations

**Type Checking**
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Type definition issues
- Generic type problems
- Interface mismatches
- Null/undefined handling

**Security & Compliance**
- Security vulnerability scans
- License compliance issues
- Dependency security alerts
- Code scanning alerts
- Secret detection failures

**Performance & Analysis**
- Bundle size violations
- Performance regression tests
- Static analysis failures
- Memory leak detection
- Lighthouse score failures

**Infrastructure & Deployment**
- Docker build failures
- Deployment script errors
- Environment configuration
- Database migration issues
- Service connectivity problems

### 3. Agent Routing Decision Matrix

Based on failure classification, recommend the optimal agent:

| Failure Type | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Complexity |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Build/Compilation | `frontend-developer` or `backend-developer` | `devops-engineer` | Medium |
| Unit Tests | `test-automator` | Language-specific agent | Low |
| Integration Tests | `test-automator` | `backend-developer` | Medium |
| E2E Tests | `test-automator` | `frontend-developer` | High |
| Linting/Formatting | `code-reviewer` | Language-specific agent | Low |
| TypeScript Errors | `frontend-developer` | `typescript-expert` | Medium |
| Security Issues | `security-engineer` | `backend-developer` | High |
| Performance | `performance-engineer` | `frontend-developer` | High |
| Infrastructure | `devops-engineer` | `backend-developer` | High |

## Analysis Guidelines

### Error Pattern Recognition
- Look for common patterns: missing imports, configuration mismatches, version conflicts
- Identify cascading failures where one issue causes multiple check failures
- Recognize environmental issues vs code issues
- Detect flaky tests vs genuine test failures

### Context-Aware Recommendations
- Consider the repository's technology stack when routing
- Factor in file changes to understand scope of impact
- Use commit messages to understand intent and potential issues
- Consider PR size and complexity for effort estimation

### Optimization Strategies
- Group related failures for efficient fixing
- Identify quick wins that can be fixed immediately
- Highlight blocking issues that prevent other fixes
- Suggest parallel vs sequential fixing approaches

### Edge Cases to Handle
- Multiple unrelated failures in single PR
- Flaky or intermittent test failures
- Infrastructure/environment-specific issues
- Dependency version conflicts
- Configuration drift between environments

## Quality Assurance

Ensure your analysis:
- ✅ Provides specific, actionable steps
- ✅ Correctly categorizes failure types  
- ✅ Routes to appropriate agents based on expertise
- ✅ Prioritizes fixes logically
- ✅ Estimates effort realistically
- ✅ Identifies dependencies between fixes
- ✅ Uses clear, technical language
- ✅ Formats output as valid JSON
